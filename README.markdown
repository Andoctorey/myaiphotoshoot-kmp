   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-ai-photo-shoot.git
   cd my-ai-photo-shoot
   ```

2. **Set Up Supabase**:
    - Create a Supabase project and note your `Project URL` and `API Key`.
    - Configure authentication, storage, and database tables as per the schema in
      `/docs/supabase-schema.sql`.
    - Update the Supabase configuration in `commonMain/kotlin/config/SupabaseConfig.kt`:
      ```kotlin
      object SupabaseConfig {
          const val URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
          const val API_KEY = "your-anon-key"
      }
      ```

3. **Configure Flux.1 API**:
    - Obtain a Flux.1 API key from [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/).
    - Add the key to `commonMain/kotlin/config/AIConfig.kt`:
      ```kotlin
      object AIConfig {
          const val FLUX_API_KEY = "your-flux-api-key"
      }
      ```

4. **Build and Run**:
    - **Android**: Open the project in Android Studio, sync Gradle, and run on an emulator or
      device.
    - **iOS**: Run in Android Studio. Or open the `iosApp` directory in Xcode and run on a simulator
      or device.
    - **Web (WASM)**: Run the following command to build and serve the Web app:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun -t --quiet
      ```
